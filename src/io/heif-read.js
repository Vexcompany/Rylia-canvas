/**
 * Reading HEIC / HEIF — the format every iPhone has shot in since iOS 11.
 *
 * Only Safari can decode one natively, so `src/io/decode.js` tries the browser
 * first and comes here when it fails. The pixels are decoded by **libheif**
 * (libheif-js: libheif + libde265 compiled to WebAssembly), loaded on demand: it
 * is about 2 MB, nothing else in Pikado needs it, and a user who never opens a
 * HEIC never downloads it. Grids (an iPhone photo is 48 tiles of 512x512),
 * rotation, mirroring, clean-aperture crops and alpha planes are all libheif's
 * job, and it does them before handing back pixels.
 *
 * What libheif does *not* do is colour management, and that is the part worth
 * getting right. A browser decoding a JPEG with a Display P3 profile hands back
 * sRGB pixels; libheif hands back the P3 numbers untouched. Left alone, every
 * iPhone photo would open visibly duller than the same photo as a JPEG. So the
 * pixels are converted to sRGB here, with the same ICC engine Convert to Profile
 * uses, and from there the document is treated exactly like an opened JPEG: it
 * is sRGB, and `noteSourceProfile` records the profile it came from. One photo,
 * one result, whichever format it arrived in.
 *
 * The colour information comes from `heif-info.js`, which reads the container
 * without decoding anything.
 *
 * Not opened, deliberately: the HDR gain map and depth/matte auxiliary images an
 * iPhone also stores (the SDR primary image is the photo), and every image but
 * the primary one in a burst or sequence.
